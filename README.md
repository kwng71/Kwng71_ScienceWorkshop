## <span style="color:blue">Overview:  </span>

It is a collection of 10 interactive worksheets on major Science experiments in major topics under the 5 themes outlined by Ministry of Education.
It aims to the comprehensive study guide for equipping students with the following key skills to answer questions on Science experiments. 

<ol>
<li>Identfication and use of keywords</li>
<li>Familiarization with three types experiment variables </li>
<li>Experiment techniques for measuring experiment outcomes    
<li>Data analysis and answering techniques for tables </li>
<li>Data analysis and answering technique for graphs </li>
<li>Linking of experiment results with real life applications/events  
</ol>

In the worksheets, leveraging on Information Technologies, the following features are added to make the learning FUN and EXPERIENTIAL.

<ol>
<li> Short video clips(1-2 min) on the relevant Science principles
<li> Informative diagrams of the experiment setup for the students to visualize the experiments.
<li> Hints with lively animation to guide students who face difficulties answering the questions
<li> “Challenge” questions for academic abled students
<li> Webcam for students to capture and submit hand-written answers or relevant photos. 
<li> Science experiment kits for supplementary learning activities
<li> A learning check list for student to reinforce his/her level of understanding.
<li> ‘Fun with Python Programming’ for picking up useful coding skills to future proof the students.
</ol>
